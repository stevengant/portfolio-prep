# Full Stack Web Developer

## Customer-Oriented Problem Solver

Hi, my name's Steve Gant and I am an up and coming full stack web developer. I am currently enrolled in Code Fellows Software Development program, transitioning into the industry after about thirteen years in HVAC wholesale. I worked many roles at my previous employer from warehouse receiving, delivery driver, inside sales, to leadership. These previous roles have rounded out my experience in customer relations, team building and leadership. I have a strong desire to continue to learn and share what I learn in order to help create a stronger team.

I am excited about getting into the tech industry because I enjoy building beautiful, functional websites as part of a collaborative team.
